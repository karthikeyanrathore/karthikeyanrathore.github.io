Hi, I’m Karthikeyan Rathore. I’m currently pursuing a <b>Master’s in Artificial Intelligence at Brandenburg University of Technology in Germany</b>. Before this, I worked as a <b>Software Developer at MicroSec</b>, where I designed and implemented IoT security solutions—ranging from certificate management systems to scalable APIs. Later, I joined <b>IIT Delhi as a Research Assistant</b>, where I worked on deep learning models for facial recognition and explored efficient methods for storing embeddings.

I enjoy working at the intersection of software engineering and AI—whether it’s building reliable backend systems, deploying solutions in the cloud, or experimenting with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. My technical background spans Python, C++, Flask, Django REST, AWS, and more, but I’m always eager to explore new tools and approaches.

Outside of work and studies, you’ll often find me cycling, swimming, or exploring new ideas that challenge me to grow as both a developer and a person.
