## Misc QnA
* Why we need an OSI model?
* why we need ip address, when we have MAC address?
* How an IP address is assigned? automatically / statically (DHCP)
* Why we need subnet masking?
* why we need a router?
* Why backend applications should be in same subnet as database app?
* what is ICMP and why we need it?
* Why do firewall blocks ICMP service? is it for security reasons and how to check if it is?
* What is WebRTC, VPN, DNS? why they all use UDP?
