### Introduction

MicroSec is a cutting-edge IoT startup based in Singapore that specializes in developing innovative solutions for the rapidly growing world of connected devices. With a focus on security and reliability, MicroSec provides end-to-end solutions that enable businesses to harness the power of IoT technology while minimizing the risks associated with data breaches and cyber attacks.

Backed by a team of skilled engineers and security experts, MicroSec has earned a reputation for delivering customized solutions that meet the unique needs of each client. From smart homes and offices to industrial automation and smart cities, MicroSec's products and services are helping to shape the future of IoT and revolutionize the way we live and work.

### Challenges and growth

Initially, I encountered some difficulties while working alongside a team of seasoned professionals. As I had no prior experience working for an organization, it was a new challenge for me. However, as time passed, I familiarised myself with the work process and learned how to approach my superiors in the right manner. Given their busy schedules, I ensure that I only approach them with significant queries while handling minor ones on my own.

Before this, I was used to working solo on projects. However, in a company's work environment, I find collaborating with other developers to be a fulfilling experience. We exchange ideas and discuss design changes, among other things. The only downside is that I work remotely, which means that I don't get to interact with my colleagues in person.

On a technical level, it was initially challenging to understand the project's code base. However, I tackled this by completing tasks and addressing issues one step at a time. One particular tool that proved difficult to understand was Docker, which forms the foundation of the project's various microservices. Docker and docker-compose are essential managers for these services. While I have since gained a better understanding of Docker, I recognize that I still have much to learn, especially concerning how docker networking operates behind the scenes.

### Agile Workflow at MicroSec: Navigating Sprints and Maximizing Efficiency

At MicroSec, we operate on a two-week sprint schedule. During each sprint, the TPM assigns tasks or topics to each developer. Some tasks may exceed the two-week duration, in which case they get carried over to the subsequent sprint. At the end of each sprint, we conduct a comprehensive review, planning, and retrospective session.

During the sprint review, each developer or engineer showcases their completed, reviewed, or pending work through images or videos that were provided in the previous sprint. The sprint retro allows for valuable feedback from everyone on how the sprint went for them, providing opportunities for process improvements. In the sprint planning session, we collectively discuss and plan for the forthcoming sprint, which ensures that everyone is on the same page and ready to tackle the new set of tasks.

### Exploring the Intricacies of Developing and Maintaining High-Quality Software at MicroSec

I have gained invaluable insights into the intricacies of developing and maintaining high-quality software. While creating software is a significant challenge, the maintenance phase is even more daunting. The work process involved in developing a major feature for our product entails numerous demanding steps. Given that our LCMS software is primarily based on the PKI framework and various cybersecurity concepts, I relished the opportunity to expand my knowledge in these areas.

Exploring various cryptographic library APIs proved to be an enjoyable experience. Our team members predominantly use Ubuntu or other Linux distros as the operating system, while Python and various libraries are utilized to achieve specific outputs. Additionally, we leverage a diverse range of tools and technologies, such as Docker, OpenSSL, MQTT, django-REST, Flask, and PostgreSQL, to streamline our development and maintenance efforts.
